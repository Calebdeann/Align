# /figma - Implement a screen from Figma design

Build a screen step-by-step based on user's Figma design.

## Instructions

1. Ask user to share the Figma design:
   - Screenshot/image
   - Or description of the layout

2. Break down the design into:
   - Layout structure (containers, spacing)
   - Components needed
   - Colors (verify against theme.ts)
   - Typography (verify against fonts)

3. Build incrementally:
   - Start with layout skeleton
   - Add components one by one
   - Style to match design
   - Get user feedback at each step

## Process

1. **Analyze:** "I see [describe layout]. Let me build this step by step."
2. **Layout first:** Create the screen structure
3. **Components:** Add each component
4. **Styling:** Match colors, fonts, spacing
5. **Review:** "How does this look? Any adjustments?"

## Important

- Don't guess - ask if unclear
- Use existing theme values when possible
- Check if component already exists before creating
- Keep asking user for feedback
